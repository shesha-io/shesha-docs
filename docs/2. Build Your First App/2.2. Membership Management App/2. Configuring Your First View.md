# 2. Configuring Your First View

A big benefit of Shesha is that it allows you to create the most common types of views purely through configuration i.e. no coding required.

In this chapter, we are going to take you through the process of configuring some basic views to allow the user **to view the list of members, register new members and view the details of existing members**.

In this section, you learn how to:

- Create a `Table View` to list and search for members
- reate a `Create View` to create a new member
- Create a `Details View` to view and update details of a member
- Update the `Main Menu` to allow users to navigate to your views

## Prerequisites
In order to complete the tutorial successfully, you will need to complete the previous section on **Setting up the Project** and ensure the following items are set-up.

- A Test Environment with Admin Access


# Configurations

## 1. Creating the Members Table View
We will be creating a table that we will use to manage our members. You can click on Create New to bring up the Create Dialog. 

- Navigate to **Configurations > Forms** - This view lists all the forms configured in your application and at the moment it is empty. 

![Chapter2Image1](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter2Images/Chapter2Image1.png?raw=true)

- Therefore, to create your first form click on the `Create New` toolbar button to display the new form dialog:

![Chapter2Image2](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter2Images/Chapter2Image2.png?raw=true)


- Complete the following configuration:
    * **Module** - Specifies the Shesha module the new form configuration will be saved under. 
Set this to `Membership`
    * **Template** - Specifies the template to use for the new form. 
Since we are creating a Table View select `table-view`.
    * **Name** - A name for the form. This should be unique within the module selected and may only contain alpha-numeric characters and '-'. 
E.g. `members-table`
    * **Label** - A user friendly name for the form 
E.g. `Members Table View`
    * **Description** - More information about the form
  E.g. `This table view is used to display a list of all members.`
    * **Model Type** - Specify the type of Entity you want the form to bind to. This determines the information that the form will be able to access and display.
  Since we will be using the standard `Person` entity that comes out-of-the-box with Shesha to store Member information, select `Shesha.Domain.Person (Shesha.Core.Person)`

Once you click on the Ok button you will be directed to the **Forms Designer, which already has a basic table view form configuration based on the template you selected**. But you will notice that the table is empty. 

Here is a quick breakdown of some of the main components of the Forms Designer we will use to **configure the columns to display data on the table**. 


![](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter2Images/Chapter2Image3.png?raw=true)


### Configuring the Table Columns

You can configure your columns by hovering over the **datatable** component handle on your forms components and clicking it, which will now allow you to see the properties of the datatable in your **Properties** sidebar.

![image.png](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter2Images/Chapter2Image4.png?raw=true)


- Click on the **Customize columns** button on the **Properties** sidebar, which should bring up the **Configure Columns** pop-up window. You can click on the ‘Add Column’ button to add your table columns. 

![image.png](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter2Images/Chapter2Image5.png?raw=true)


- After adding a table column, the recently empty ‘Properties’ sidebar should be populated with options to **configure your column**.

![image.png](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter2Images/Chapter2Image6.png?raw=true)


In this case we will be configuring the column to show the **FullName** of a member. 

On the **Property Name** setting on the **Properties** sidebar, select the Entity property that you wish to display on the column. This can be done by typing to bring up the list of available properties. If the property name selected is what you would like your caption to be, you can use the suffixed lightning bolt icon button to autocomplete the column caption to match the property name.

Before you close the **Configure Columns** menu, configure the following properties as well.

- **Firstname** 
    * **Property Name:** firstName 
    * **Caption:** First Name
- **Lastname** 
    * **Property Name:** lastName 
    * **Caption:** Last Name
- **Cellphone** 
    * **Name:** mobileNumber1 
    * **Label:** Cellphone Number

Once you are done you can click **save** to confirm the column configurations.

![image.png](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter2Images/Chapter2Image7.png?raw=true)


The moment you click save you will see that the table you had created becomes populated with data that already exists. This is because we used the **Person** entity which is a part of the base Shesha model and the starter project database comes with sample data already loaded.

![image.png](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter2Images/Chapter2Image8.png?raw=true)


### Adding the Table View Title

- Navigate to the **Builder Widgets** and search for the **Title** component.
- **Drag** the Title component and **drop** it wherever you want it to be.
- On the **Properties** sidebar, change the '**Content**' of this Title component to '**All Members**'.
 
![image.png](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter2Images/Chapter2Image9.png?raw=true)


You can toggle **Preview** mode so that you can get an idea of how the form looks to end-users. 

### Save, Set Ready and Publish

- Although the form configuration is complete, it will not be available to end-users unless it is published. So, once you are satisfied with how the form looks, you can proceed to **Save and Set Ready** the form, which will have it ready to be published to a live version.


![image.png](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter2Images/Chapter2Image10.png?raw=true)


- **Publish** the now **ready** form version to the live version.

![image.png](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter2Images/Chapter2Image11.png?raw=true)


![image.png](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter2Images/Chapter2Image0.png?raw=true)


- Now that our form is published to the live version, how do we access it? For this tutorial we will be creating a **direct link to the Members Table View**.


## 2. Updating the Main Menu

Now that we have our Members table setup we will need an easy way to access it for our users. We will be **creating a link in our Main Menu that navigates users to the newly created view**.

Toggle the **edit mode** button in order to leave `live mode` and enter `edit mode` to be able to customize the main menu.

![image.png](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter2Images/Chapter2Image12.png?raw=true)


- Once you are in edit mode you can click on the main menu in order to configure the menu items. You will notice that the editable areas have dashed borders. As shown below.

![image.png](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter2Images/Chapter2Image13.png?raw=true)


- Clicking on the Main Menu will take you to the Main Menu configuration screen.

![image.png](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter2Images/Chapter2Image14.png?raw=true)

<br>

To create a menu item for the Members Table View, click on **Add New Item**, which will populate the **Properties** sidebar with options to configure your menu item. We will be using the following settings to configure our new **Menu Item**.

- **Item Type** - The type of menu item to create. 
      - Select `Button`
- **Title** - The title for the menu item. 
      - E.g. `Members`
- **Icon** - The icon to display for the menu item. 
      - E.g. `IdcardOutlined` 
- **Button Action** - The action to be performed when user selects the menu item. 
      - Select `Navigate`
- **Target Url** - The Url to navigate to when the user selectes the menu item. The url for configured forms needs to follow this convention:`/dynamic/{Module name}/{Form name}` where:
     * **dynamic**- standard segment that indicates the url is for a configured (dynamic) form
     * **{Module name}** - The name of the module the form to navigate to belongs to.
     * **{Form name}** - The name of the configured form to navigate to.
  
  The value should therefore be `/dynamic/Membership/members-table` 

![image.png](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter2Images/Chapter2Image15.png?raw=true)

- Click on **Ok** and **Close Edit Mode**. You should now be able to see your recently created **Menu Item** on the Main Menu Sidebar and can navigate to the specified URL. 

![image.png](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter2Images/Chapter2Image16.png?raw=true)

## 3. Adding a Member Create View
Now that we have a way to view a list of our Members in a table and can access the table we will need a way to create new members. You can go into the **Configurations > Forms** and create a new view using the following information:

- **Module** -  `Membership`
- **Template** - `form-view` or `blank-view`
- **Name** - `members-create`
- **Label** - `Members Create`
- **Description** - `This create view is used to register a new member.` 
- **Model Type** - `Shesha.Domain.Person (Shesha.Core.Person)`

![image.png](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter2Images/Chapter2Image17.png?raw=true)

You should now have access to the **Data** panel. You can drag the following fields from the **Data** panel onto the **edit area** in order to configure them. You can edit these properties in the properties window to edit the labels as you wish.

- **Firstname** 
    * **Name:** firstName 
    * **Caption:** First Name
- **Lastname** 
    * **Name:** lastName 
    * **Caption:** Last Name
- **Cellphone** 
    * **Name:** mobileNumber1 
    * **Label:** Cellphone

![image.png](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter2Images/Chapter2Image18.png?raw=true)

Since we want to create a new person record, we need to specify the endpoint the form should be submitted to. This can be done by clicking on the **Settings** button on form designer mode, which will bring up a **Form Settings** modal.


![image.png](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter2Images/Chapter2Image19.png?raw=true)


This form settings modal allows you to configure key form-level properties and events such as the url of the api to be called to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) actions on the form's entity.

On the **POST Url** field of the **Form Settings** modal, search for the relevant endpoint required to create a new `Person` entity, namely `api/services/Core/Person/Create`. You will note that the auto-complete search is available to select the end-point from amongst all the end-points currently exposed by the back-end.

![image.png](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter2Images/Chapter2Image20.png?raw=true)

- Click on **Ok** to confirm the changes to the form configuration and close the modal.
- **Save,Set Ready** AND **publish** the form to the live version.

### Adding a Button to Display the Create View
We now need to go back and update the configuration of the **Members Table View** to add a toolbar button that will display the Member Create View so that users can create new members. 

- Go to the **Members Table** form configuration and go into **form designer mode**.

![image.png](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter2Images/Chapter2Image21.png?raw=true)

- Create a **new version** of the form to be able to edit the form.

![image.png](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter2Images/Chapter2Image22.png?raw=true)

- We will be editing the **Button Group**. Click on the **Button Group** and then click **Customize Button Group**.

![image.png](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter2Images/Chapter2Image23.png?raw=true)


In the **Configure Buttons** window you can edit the **Add button** so that it points to the **Create Member** form view. Make sure the following information is set:

- **Label**- `Create Member`
- **Button Type** - `Link`
- **Action Name** - `Common > Show Dialog`
- **Title** - `Add New Member`
- **Modal Form** - `members-create`
- **Show Modal Buttons** - `True`
- **Submit HTTP Verb** - POST
- **Handle Success** - `True`
- **Action Name** - `TABLE_VIEW_TEMPLATE_ID: Refresh table`

![image.png](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter2Images/Chapter2Image24.png?raw=true)


Click save to confirm the **Button Group** changes and make sure you click **Save and Set Ready AND publish the form to the live version** on the Forms Designer to confirm the changes to the table.

To test your configuration simply change your version from **Live** to **Latest** and navigate to the Members table view and click on the **Create Member** to bring up the create member form. Complete the form and click **Ok**.

![image.png](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter2Images/Chapter2Image25.png?raw=true)

- Once the table refreshes, you should now be able to see the record of your newly created member on the **Members Table**.

![image.png](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter2Images/Chapter2Image26.png?raw=true)

## 4. Creating the Member Details View

Now we shall create the Members Details form to allow users to view and edit the details of a member.

Go into the **Configurations > Forms** and create a new view using the following information:

- **Module** -  `Membership`
- **Template** - `details-view`
- **Name** - `member-details`
- **Label** -  `Member Details`
- **Description** - `This details view is used to view the details of a member.`
- **Model Type** - `Shesha.Domain.Person (Shesha.Core.Person)`

![image.png](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter2Images/Chapter2Image27.png?raw=true)

- Once on the form designer of the details view, this is what you will see:
 
![image.png](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter2Images/Chapter2Image28.png?raw=true)

### Specifying the end-point to fetch Member details from
Since we want to view details for a specific Member enttiy, we need to bind this form to the relevant endpoint. This can be done by clicking on the **Settings** button on form designer mode, which will bring up a **Form Settings** modal.

On the **GET Url** field of the **Form Settings** modal, search for the relevant endpoint associated with the table you would like to query from. In this example, since we would like to get a person’s details, we are going to search for an endpoint to **GET** from the **Shesha.Domain.Person (Shesha.Core.Person)** table.

![image.png](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter2Images/Chapter2Image29.png?raw=true)


### Adding a dynamic form title

We can make the title of the view dynamic to give it a more personal touch. To display dynamic text Shesha uses <a href="https://github.com/janl/mustache.js" target="_blank">mustache templating</a> as its templating syntax. It works by simply inserting 'tags' where dynamic text should be inserted e.g. `My template text {{propertyName}}`.

- Selecting the ‘title’ component handle on the details view edit area. 
- On the properties sidebar set the **Content** property to `Details of {{fullName}}`

![image.png](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter2Images/Chapter2Image30.png?raw=true)

This will now display the full name of the member whose details are being viewed as part of the title.

### Adding member properties to display
- You can drag and drop your fields from the ‘Data’ panel that you would like to display when this page is displayed. 

![image.png](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter2Images/Chapter2Image31.png?raw=true)


### Publishing the form
- Once you are done you click **Save and Set Ready AND publish the form to the live version** to confirm your form.


## 5. Updating the Members Table View to drill-down into the Member Details view
To navigate to the newly created details form we now have to go back to the **Members Table View** to add a column that allows us to drill-down into the details of a particular Member.

- Find the `members-table` form configuration and create a new version to be able to edit the form.

![image.png](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter2Images/Chapter2Image32.png?raw=true)

- Once in the form designer mode of the **Members Table View**, click on the **datatable** component handler, and click on the **Customize Columns** option in the **Properties** sidebar.


![image.png](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter2Images/Chapter2Image33.png?raw=true)

- Add a new column with the following information:

     * **Type** - `Action`
     * **Icon** - `SearchOutlined`
     * **Action Name** - `Common > Navigate`
     * **Target Url** - `/dynamic/Membership/member-details?id={{selectedRow.id}}`

  Understanding the Target URL
  
   * **dynamic** - standard url segment indicating that the form to navigate to is a configured (dynamic) form
   * **Membership** - is the name of the module the form to navigate to lives in
   * **member-details**- is the name of the form to navigate to
   * **?id={{selectedRow.id}}**- queries the row that was selected

![image.png](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter2Images/Chapter2Image34.png?raw=true)

- The **Members Details View** is now accessible from the **Members Table View** through the column with the search icon on the table. 

- **Save and Set Ready AND publish** the form to the live version.

![image.png](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter2Images/Chapter2Image35.png?raw=true)

- Once on the new and updated **Members Table View** read-only mode with the additional column, when you click on the search icon for a relevant row, you will be **redirected to the details view** for the selected member.
