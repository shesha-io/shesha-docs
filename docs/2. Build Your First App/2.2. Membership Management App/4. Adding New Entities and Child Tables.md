# 4. Adding New Entities and Child Tables

Let's say now we would like to be able to track all the payments for each of the members. For this we will need to create a new **MembershipPayment** Entity and have all payments related to a Member displayed on the details view.

In this section, you learn how to:

- Create a New Entity
- Create a Migration Class
- Configure a Child Table
- Configure a Filter for the Table

## Prerequisites
In order to complete the tutorial successfully, you will need to complete the previous section on **Extending the Domain Model** and ensure the following items are set-up.

- A Test Environment with Admin Access
- <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio</a>

# Backend 
## 1. Create a new ‘MembershipPayment’ entity
1. Navigate to **Module > Boxfusion.Membership.Common.Domain > Domain**
1. Right click on the **Domain** folder, **Add > Class**
1. Give your class the name of: **MembershipPayment.cs**, and click on **Add**
1. Populate your class with the following:


```
using Abp.Domain.Entities.Auditing;
using Boxfusion.Membership.Common.Domain.Domain;
using Shesha.Domain.Attributes;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
namespace Boxfusion.Membership.Common.Domain.Domain
{
    /// <summary>
    ///
    /// </summary>
    [Entity(TypeShortAlias = "Membership.MembershipPayment")]
    public class MembershipPayment : FullAuditedEntity<Guid>
    {
        /// <summary>
        ///
        /// </summary>
        public virtual Member Member { get; set; }
        /// <summary>
        /// The payment amount
        /// </summary>
        public virtual double Amount { get; set; }
        /// <summary>
        /// The date when the payment was made
        /// </summary>
        public virtual DateTime PaymentDate { get; set; }
    }
}

```

## 2. Create a migration class
1. Navigate to **Module > Boxfusion.Membership.Common.Domain > Migrations**
1. Right click on the **Migrations** folder, **Add > Class**
1. Create a new migration class with a file name following this format: **M[YEAR][MONTH][DAY][HOUR][MINUTE][SECONDS].cs e.g. M20220805085300.cs** for 5 August 2022 08:53:00.
1. Add the below code:

```
using FluentMigrator;
using Shesha.FluentMigrator;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
namespace Boxfusion.Membership.Common.Domain.Migrations
{
    [Migration(20221214184200)]
    public class M20221214184200 : Migration
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Code to execute when executing the migrations
        /// </summary>
        public override void Up()
        {
            Create.Table("Mem_MembershipPayments")
                .WithIdAsGuid()
                .WithFullAuditColumns()
                .WithForeignKeyColumn("MemberId", "Core_Persons").Nullable()
                .WithColumn("Amount").AsDouble().Nullable()
                .WithColumn("PaymentDate").AsDateTime().Nullable();
        }
        /// <summary>
        /// Code to execute when rolling back the migration
        /// </summary>
        public override void Down()
        {
            throw new NotImplementedException();
        }
    }
}
```

##**3. Run and check database**
You can run your application in order to update your database. Your new updated column should be now added to your table.

# Configurations 
## 1. Adding Payments to the Members Details View 

- Open the **members-details-view** on Form Designer Mode and create a new version of the form.
- On the **Builder Widgets** panel, search, select, and drag a **Datatable Context** component onto the edit area just below the existing collapsible panel. 
- Once the **Datatable Context** component has been dragged and dropped onto the Edit Area, on the ‘Properties’ sidebar, search and select **MembershipPayment** on the **Entity Type** autocomplete.

- On the **Builder Widgets** panel, search, select, and drag a **Child table** component onto the edit area inside the **Datatable Context** component. 
- On the **Properties** sidebar of the **Child table** component, click on **Customize filters** to create your own filter or adjust table settings and ordering.

![](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter4Images/Chapter4Image2.png?raw=true)

- On the **Configure Filters** modal that shows after clicking **Customize filters**, click on **Add New Item**, and populate the **Properties** sidebar with the following:

    * Title - **All Membership Payments**
    * Use Expression - **true**
    * Query Builder - **member == {{data.id}}** (see example below)

![](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter4Images/memberFilter.png?raw=true)

![](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter4Images/Chapter4Image4.png?raw=true)

- Click on save and set **Selected filter** to the filter you just created and add your Title as **Membership Payments**.
- On the **Builder Widgets** panel, search, select, and drag a **DataTable** component onto the edit area inside the **Child table** component.
- On the **Properties** sidebar of the **DataTable** component, click on **Customize Columns** to configure columns in your table to have the following: 

![](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter4Images/Chapter4Image5.png?raw=true)

![](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter4Images/Chapter4Image6.png?raw=true)

**Member FullName**

- **Property Name:** member.fullName - (the DotNotion is used to tap into properties of a foreign association)
- **Caption:** Full Name

**Payment Date**

- **Property Name:** paymentDate
- **Caption:** Payment Date

**Amount**

- **Property Name:** amount
- **Caption:** Amount

![](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter4Images/Chapter4Image7.png?raw=true)

- Click **Ok** to confirm your column configurations.

![](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter4Images/Chapter4Image8.png?raw=true)

Now that we have a place to show the payments that the member has made, you are ready to cash in. This can be done by creating a **create view** to enable the member to make a payment.

## 2. Create a MembershipPayment Create View

You can go into the **Configurations > Forms** and create a new view using the following information:

- **Module** -  Membership
- **Template** - blank-view
- **Name** - membership-payments-create
- **Label** - Membership Payment Create
- **Description** - This create view is used to create a new membership payment.
- **Model Type** - MembershipPayment

![](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter4Images/Chapter4Image9.png?raw=true)

You should now have access to the **Data** panel. You can drag the following fields from the Data panel onto the edit area in order to configure them. You can edit these properties in the properties window to edit the labels as you wish.

**Member**

- **Name:** member
- **Label:** Member

**Amount**

- **Name:** amount
- **Label:** Amount

**Payment Date**

- **Name:** paymentDate
- **Label:** Payment Date

If you don't want your calendar to have a time format, simply uncheck the **show time** property on the **Properties** sidebar of the **Date component**.

## 3. Binding form to an endpoint
Since we want to create a new membership payment entry, we need to bind this form to the relevant endpoint. This can be done by clicking on the **Settings** button on form designer mode, which will bring up a **Form Settings** modal. This modal allows you to configure how the overall form will perform. 

On the **POST Url** field of the **Form Settings** modal, search for the relevant endpoint associated with the table you would like to make an entry to. In this example, since we would like to add a membership payment, we are going to search for an endpoint to **POST** to the **MembershipPayment** table.

![](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter4Images/Chapter4Image10.png?raw=true)

Click on **Ok** to confirm the changes to the form configuration and close the modal.
**Save**, **Set Ready** AND **publish** the form to the live version. 

## 4. Configuring the Membership Payments child table in the Members Details View

We will be configuring it in the Membership Payments child table in the Members Details View and linking it to the **Add** button so that a dialog comes up when you click it allowing you to create a new membership payment.

Go to the **Members Details View** and go into **form designer mode**. Create a **new version** of the form to be able to edit the form.

We will be editing the **Child Table Button Group**. Select the **Child Table** component handler and then click **Customise Button Group**.

![](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter4Images/Chapter4Image11.png?raw=true)

In the **Buttons Configuration** window you can edit the **Add button** so that it points to the **Create Membership Payment** form view. Make sure the following information is set:

- **Label** - Create Membership Payment
- **Button Type** - Link
- **Action Name** - Common > Show Dialog
- **Title** - Add New Membership Payment
- **Modal Form** - membership-payments-create
- **Show Modal Buttons** - True
- **Submit HTTP Verb** - POST
- **Handle Success** - True
- **Action Name** - datatableContext1: Refresh table

![](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter4Images/Chapter4Image12.png?raw=true)

Click save to confirm the **Button Group** changes and make sure you click **Save and Set Ready AND publish the form to the live version** on the Forms Designer to confirm the changes to the table.

##**5. Member's detail view**
Navigate to a Member’s Detail view, Membership Payment Create child table and click on **Create Membership Payment** to bring up the create membership payment form. Complete the form and click **Ok**.

![](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter4Images/Chapter4Image13.png?raw=true)

![](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter4Images/Chapter4Image14.png?raw=true)

Once the table refreshes, you should now be able to see the record of your newly created membership payment on the **Membership Payment Child Table**.
