# 5. Creating and Calling Custom APIs

Until now, although the front-end application is clearly interacting with the back-end to retrieve data, you have not had to explicitly create any APIs for this to happen.

This is because Shesha, **automatically creates CRUD APIs for all entities in your projects**. However, if you want to enforce some custom logic you will need to create new APIs and call them from the front-end.

Imagine that we want MembershipStatus property to be updated through a more controlled process instead of allowing the end-user to simply select the status. For example, **before Activating the membership you would check if an initial payment has been received.**

In this section, you learn how to:

- Create a Custom App Service
- Expose a New Endpoint
- Test The App Service in Swagger
- Configure an Action Button
- Execute a Custom Action Script

## Prerequisites
In order to complete the tutorial successfully, you will need to complete the previous section on **Adding New Entities and Child Tables** and ensure the following items are set up.

- A Test Environment with Admin Access
- <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio</a>

# Backend
## 1. Creating an AppService

1. Create ActivateMembershipAppService
1. Create ActivateMembership end-point
    * Should retrieve list of Payments associated to the member
    * If no payments or total is less than R100 then through an exception, otherwise update the status property to Active and save
1. Test through Swagger to make sure it works

## 2. Create a new ‘ActivateMembershipAppService’ class

1. Navigate to **Module > Boxfusion.Membership.Common.Application**
1. Create a new folder and call it  **Services**
1. Right click on the **Services** folder,  **Add > Class**
1. Give your class the name of: **ActivateMembershipAppService.cs**, and click on **Add**
1. Populate your class with the following:

```
using Abp.Domain.Repositories;
using Abp.UI;
using Boxfusion.Membership.Common.Domain.Domain;
using Boxfusion.Membership.Common.Domain.Enums;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Shesha;
using Shesha.DynamicEntities.Dtos;
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace Boxfusion.Membership.Common.Services
{
    public class ActivateMembershipAppService : SheshaAppServiceBase
    {
        private readonly IRepository<Member, Guid> _memberRepo;
        private readonly IRepository<MembershipPayment, Guid> _membershipPaymentRepo;

        public ActivateMembershipAppService(IRepository<Member, Guid> memberRepo, IRepository<MembershipPayment, Guid> membershipPaymentRepo)
        {
            _memberRepo = memberRepo;
            _membershipPaymentRepo = membershipPaymentRepo;
        }

        [HttpPut, Route("[action]/{memberId}")]
        public async Task<DynamicDto<Member, Guid>> ActivateMembership(Guid memberId)
        {
            var member = await _memberRepo.GetAsync(memberId);
            var payments = await _membershipPaymentRepo.GetAllListAsync(data => data.Member.Id == memberId);

            if (payments.Count = 0) throw new UserFriendlyException("There no payments made");

            double totalAmount = 0;
            payments.ForEach(a =>
            {
                totalAmount += a.Amount;
            });

            if (totalAmount < 100) throw new UserFriendlyException("Payments made are less than 100");


            member.MembershipStatus = RefListMembershipStatuses.Active;
            var updatedMember = await _memberRepo.UpdateAsync(member);

            return await MapToDynamicDtoAsync<Member, Guid>(updatedMember);
        }
    }
}
```

## 3. Dto and Mapping

- **Shesha DynamicDto** - by using this DynamicDto, you don't have to create a Dto from scratch, this creates a Dto for you by referencing the entity passed in. Therefore, there is no need for manually creating a Dto and profile mapping.

- **Shesha MapToDynamicDtoAsync** - this maps the input data received to its entity and returns the data as a response. 

## 4. Run and check swagger to see the custom endpoint

# Configurations
## 1. Configuring an action button for ‘ActivateMembership’

Now we need to configure an action button in order to be able to call the custom API we just created. We will be doing this in a **members details view** to be able to activate membership for that specific member. 

Go to the **Members Details View** and go into **form designer mode**. Create a **new version** of the form to be able to edit the form.

Click on the **buttonGroup** component handler and click on the **Customize Button Group** on the **Properties** sidebar, which will bring up a ‘Buttons Configuration’ modal popup.  

![](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter5Images/Chapter5Image2.png?raw=true)


Add a new button group item and configure with the following properties:

- Label - **Activate Membership**
- Button Type - **Link**
- Action Name - **Common > Execute Script**
- Expression code - **Add the following expression code:**

```
(function () {
  if (data) {
      const PATH = `/ActivateMembership/${data.id}`;
        http.put(`${PATH}`).then(onSuccess).catch(onError);  
  }
})();
 
function onSuccess(resp) {
  location.reload();
}
 
function onError(_e) {
  message.error('Failed to Activate Membership');
}
```

![](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter5Images/Chapter5Image3.png?raw=true)

- **Save** , **Set Ready** AND **publish** the form to the live version.

## 2. Membership details view

Enter into a **Details View of a Member**. For the purposes of this example, this member has only made payment of R50.00

![](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter5Images/Chapter5Image4.png?raw=true)

When you try to activate membership by clicking on the ‘Activate Membership’ button, this will give an error message because no payments have been made to activate the membership.

![](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter5Images/Chapter5Image5.png?raw=true)

Make a membership payment of R60 by clicking on the **Membership Payment Create** button on the Membership Payments Child Table. Once a payment has been made and the requirements of activating a membership have been met, we can click the **Activate Membership** button again. This should now set the **Membership Status** to **Active**.

![](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter5Images/Chapter5Image6.png?raw=true)

## 3. Disabling ‘Activate Membership’ Button
After you have activated the membership, you will notice that the ‘Activate Membership’ button is still active, which should not be the case if the user already has an active membership. We have to disable this button in cases like these. 

This can be done by heading to the **Members Details View** and going into **form designer mode**. Create a **new version** of the form to be able to edit the form.

Click on the **buttonGroup** component handler and click on the **Customize Button Group** on the **Properties** sidebar, which will bring up a **Buttons Configuration** modal popup. Select the **Activate Membership** button item and on the **Properties** sidebar on the **Custom Enabled** property, paste in the following code:  

` return data.membershipStatus != 2;`

![](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter5Images/Chapter5Image7.png?raw=true)

## 4. Updating the status tag for Membership status
A standard Details View template comes with a status tag component, which we are going to use to show the status of the user’s membership. 

This can be done by heading to the **Members Details View** and going into **form designer mode**. Create a **new version** of the form to be able to edit the form.

Click on the **statusTag** component handler and click on the **Default Mapping** on the **Properties** sidebar, which will bring up a code editor where you can paste in the following code:  

![](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter5Images/Chapter5Image8.png?raw=true)
 
```
{
  "mapping": [
    {
      "code": 1,
      "text": "In Progress",
      "color": "#4DA6FF",
      "override": "Still Busy!"
    },
    {
      "code": 2,
      "text": "Active",
      "color": "#87d068"
    },
    {
      "code": 3,
      "text": "Cancelled",
      "color": "#cd201f"
    }
  ],
  "default": {
    "override": "NOT RECOGNISED",
    "text": "NOT RECOGNISED",
    "color": "#f50"
  }
}
```

Click on the **statusTag** component handler and click on the **Value Expression** on the **Properties** sidebar, which will bring up a code editor where you can paste in the following code:  

![](https://github.com/Boxfusion/shesha-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/chapter5Images/Chapter5Image9.png?raw=true)

```
switch(data?.membershipStatus) 
{
  case parseInt("1"):
    return 1;
    break;
  case parseInt("2"):
    return 2;
    break;
  case parseInt("3"):
    return 3;
    break;
}
```

The default value of the statusTag component, as you can see on the **Properties** sidebar, has been set to 1. Clear the **Value** field in the **Properties** sidebar to make the statusTag component fully dynamic.

**Save**, **Set Ready** AND **publish** the form to the live version.

This is how a details view of an **active member** should look like:

This is how a details view of a membership which is **yet to be activated** looks like:
