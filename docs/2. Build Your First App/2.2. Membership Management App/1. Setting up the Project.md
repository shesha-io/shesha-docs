# 1. Setting up the Project

We are going to be using the Shesha Starter App to get our project up and running. The Starter project is already configured with most of the configuration and settings you will need to get going.

In this section, you learn how to:

- Download the Starter Project - <a href="https://getshesha.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">getshesha website</a>
-  Setup the Database - <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16" target="_blank">SQL Server Management Studio</a>
-  Setup the Backend - <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio</a> 
-  Setup the Frontend - <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> with <a href="https://nodejs.org/download/release/v12.22.3/" target="_blank">Node.js</a>

## 1. Download the Starter Project

The easiest way to get started is by downloading a Starter Shesha project from the <a href="https://getshesha.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">getshesha website</a>.

You can provide various parameters to customise the Namespace of the starter project generated. For our example we are going to use the information below:

- Company Name - **Boxfusion**
- Project Name - **Membership**
- Project Type - **Full: Empty Starter Project**

Therefore, the Namespace of the solution will start with `Boxfusion.Membership`.

A zip file including the following will be generated that you can then customise to your needs:

- **Adminportal (Frontend)** - A reactjs solution for the front end
- **Backend** - An Asp.Net Core solution for the backend
- **Database** - A seeded SQL database with sample data

Unzip the folder generated to your preferred destination.
## 2. Setup the Database (SQL Server Management Studio) - From a `.bacpac` file

Before we can start running the backend project we will need to restore a clean database using the **Membership.bacpac** file in the project starter.

1. Open **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio**
1. Right-click **Databases**
1. Select **Import Data-tier Application...** and then click **Next** on the "Introduction" step of the dialog
1. Click Browse on the **Import from the local disk** section and locate your Membership.bacpac file you downloaded with the project starter. 
1. You can then click **Next** on the "Import Settings" dialog once you have located the database.
1. In the **New database name:** field in the "Database Settings" step you can give your database a name, make sure that you type in Membership and then click Next
1. Click **Finish** in the bottom of the "Summary" step
1. You can verify that the backup was successfully imported by navigating to the generated database **> Tables > dbo.Core_Persons**, and querying the top 1000 rows.

## 3. Setup the Backend (Visual Studio)

Now that you have restored your database you can start setting up your backend. We will be using the **backend** folder in the starter project to set up the backend.

Let's first find our solution that we downloaded when generating the start up project and open it.

1. Open the starter project folder
1. Navigate to **backend** and open the folder
1. Double click the **Boxfusion.Membership.sln** solution (or whatever you may have set as the project name when generating the project) and also make sure that you open the solution with visual studio 2022.

Now that we have found the project let us connect the database to the backend and run the solution.

1. Right-click the solution and select **Restore NuGet Packages**
1. Expand the project **Boxfusion.Membership.Web.Host**
1. If you didn't name your database as '**Membership**' in SQL, scroll down to **appsettings.json** and change the default connection string to point to your database e.g. the format of the connection string is:
`"Default":"Data Source=YOUR_SERVER_NAME; Initial Catalog=YOUR_DATABASE_NAME;Integrated Security=SSPI",`
1. You can run your application by going to the menu and selecting **Debug > Start Debugging** or by **clicking F5**
1. The application should open in your browser on the default **Swagger API page**, as shown below.

6. Swagger-UI search allows you to filter the endpoint content on the page. Therefore, simply search for any endpoint you want to use in the search bar.

## 4. Setup the Frontend (Visual Studio Code)

Now that you have restored your database and set-up your backend you can start setting up your frontend. We will be using the adminportal frontend project to set-up your frontend.

1. Open **Microsoft Visual Studio Code**
1. In your file menu navigate to **File > Open Folder**
1. In your file browser open the **adminportal** folder from your downloaded starter project. Click **Select Folder** to open this directory.
1. In the menu open a new terminal by going to **Terminal > New Terminal**
1. Check if you have version **v12.22.3 of node**, which is needed to run the frontend, installed by running the following command on the terminal **‘node -v’**
1. In the new terminal window enter the command **‘npm i --legacy-peer-deps -f’** and hit enter to install node_modules.
1. Open the **‘web.config.js’** file found in the directory **public > static > config**.
1. Change the value entry for baseUrl to reflect the URL of your backend which is currently  running from the backend setup. This is how your baseurl should look **baseUrl: 'https://localhost:44362'**,
1. You can now run your frontend application by typing **‘npm run dev’** in your terminal.
1. To login to the admin portal, the username is **admin** and the password is **123qwe**.
1. Once you login, you have your first Shesha application running successfully and this is what the home page should look like!
