# 2.1. Tutorial Overview 

This is an introductory tutorial into Shesha that will expose you to all the key Shesha concepts you will need to allow you to quickly start building your own **Shesha-based applications**.

For the tutorial we will take you through the process of building a '**Membership Management**' application. The Membership Management could typically be used by a Club to track its members, payment of membership fees and processing of applications. We take you through the process of building the application, step-by-step, whilst exposing you to the key concepts.

Once completed you will be ready to build your very own Shesha application.
