# 1. Configuring a Details View

Once you have created a form for capturing data you will need to be able to view the data. We will be working with displaying data using a Details View.

You can navigate to the forms settings page which is one of the static sessions of Shesha application where forms are managed. The URL is `https://[client-url]/settings/forms/`.

# Creating the View

You can click on the "Create New" button group button to open the Create Form Dialog.

We will start off by creating the view. In this case we will be creating a view for capturing the data for the core Person object in the ABP table.

We will capture the following information in our case:

- **Type of View** - `Details View`
- **Name** - `Learning Detail View (Person)`
- **Description** - `We will use this form to learn about creating detail form views in Shesha based on the Person model`
- **Path** - `learn-detail-view`
- **Model Types** - `Shesha.Domain.Person (Shesha.Core.Person)`

Above is a snapshot of the data that we have captured. You can click submit to create this form.

Because we have used a Details View and selected the Person model you will notice that our forms designer comes preconfigured with a few goodies for us to look at. Mainly these are:

- **Title** - A title area for us to configure. You can use mustache and other variables available to you to configure this section.
- **Button Group** - The form comes with a default button group for editing and saving the data from the form which you can further customise.
- **Data** - The Form designer now comes with a Data area that displays properties for your selected model.

A snapshot of our preconfigured form is below:

You can click save and preview your form in order to view your form in the view that users will see it.
