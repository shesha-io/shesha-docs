# 3. Configuring a Table View

Table Views are critical for viewing multiple rows of data at any given moment. We will be using table views to interact with multiple rows of data in this next section.

You can navigate to the forms settings page which is one of the static sessions of Shesha application where forms are managed. The URL is `https://[client-url]/settings/forms/`.

# Creating the View

You can click on the "Create New" button group button to open the Create Form Dialog.

We will start off by creating the view. In this case we will be creating a view for capturing the data for the core Person object in the ABP table.

We will capture the following information in our case:

- **Type of View** - `Table View`
- **Name** - `Learning Table View (Person)`
- **Description** - `We will use this form to learn about creating table views in Shesha based on the Person model`
- **Path** - `learn-table-view`
- **Model Types** - `Shesha.Domain.Person (Shesha.Core.Person)`

Above is a snapshot of the data that we have captured. You can click submit to create this form.

This will setup a canvas for you in the forms designer with the following sections preconfigured:

- **Filters** - This is a property that you will use to group the data. It is dynamic and you can use the expression builder to configure it.
- **Sorting** - These are properties to assist the using to visual the data by enabling and disabling column visibility.
- **Pagination** - Pagination allows the user to trim the amount of results returned from the server.
- **Button Groups** - The button group section will allow you to add buttons for your form. In our case we have the following buttons loaded by default.
  - **Add** - This allows us to hook a form up that we want to use to add new records.
  - **Export** - This allows us to download an excel version of our data that we can use offline.
- **Data Panel** - The data panel shows your model fields and attributes that you can use to configure your table.

# Configuring Columns

At the moment our table may look empty. That is because we have not configured our columns yet. You can configure your columns by hovering over the "Datatable" handle on your forms area and clicking it.

Once you have clicked on this area you should now be able to see the properties for the data table in your properties window.

We want to set our default columns so we will click on the "Customise Columns" button in the properties window.

This should bring up the "Configure Columns" window. You can click on the "Add Column" button to add your columns. This will further bring up a window where you can set your column properties. 

In this case we will be configuring the column to show the "First Name" of the user as shown in the image below.

This just consists of us setting the the Property Name. You can start typing to bring up a list of options for the property name. You will also need to set a caption for the column in the Caption property.

Before you close the "Configure Columns" menu configure the following properties as well.

- **First Name**
    * Property Name: FirstName
    * Caption: First Name
- **Last Name**
    * Property Name: LastName
    * Caption: Last Name
- **Gender**
    * Property Name: Gender
    * Caption: Gender
- **Date of Birth**
    * Property Name: DateOfBirth
    * Caption: Date of Birth
- **Organisation**
    * Property Name: OrganisationDepartment
    * Caption: Organisation

Once you are done you can click save to save the column configurations.

The moment you click save you will see that the table you had created becomes populated with data that already exists. This is because we used the Person model which is used by various models and sections within Shesha and may already have data associated with it.
