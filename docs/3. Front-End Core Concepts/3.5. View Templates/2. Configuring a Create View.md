# 2. Configuring a Create View

One of the critical capabilities with Shesha is being able to create forms dynamically for capturing data based on a model. We will be working with the forms settings section to create a create form.

You can navigate to the forms settings page which is one of the static sessions of Shesha application where forms are managed. The URL is `https://[client-url]/settings/forms/`.

# Creating the View

You can click on the "Create New" button group button to open the Create Form Dialog.

We will start off by creating the view. In this case we will be creating a view for capturing the data for the core Person object in the ABP table.

We will capture the following information in our case:

- **Type of View** - `Form View`
- **Name** - `Learning Create View (Person)`
- **Description** - `We will use this form to learn about creating create form views in Shesha based on the Person model`
- **Path** - `learn-create-view`
- **Model Types** - `Shesha.Domain.Person (Shesha.Core.Person)`

Above is a snapshot of the data that we have captured. You can click submit to create this form.

This will present us with a blank forms designer for us to start configuring our form.

# Settings

We will need to configure the model property by going to the settings cog on the form designer in order for us to setup the model type.

Here we select our person Object from the model type autocomplete. You can click ok. This will add a new "Data" panel to your forms designer.

# Data

Because you have configured your data model in the settings window you will now have access to all the properties of the Person model in the Data Panel.

# Building the Form

Because we have configured the form with the model type we are going to be using the Data panel to configure our form. This will allow us to drag and drop fields onto our form and have the fields preconfigured with controls that our bound to our model.

Drag the following properties onto your form:

- First Name (String)
- Last Name (String)
- Date Of Birth (Date)
- Gender (Reference List)
- Organisation (Entity List)

We used these fields in order to demonstrate how the properties get rendered automatically on the forms designer canvas. Below is how your forms designer should look after dropping this properties in.

You will notice that your fields have been rendered on the canvas using the following controls:

- First Name (Text Field)
- Last Name (Text Field)
- Date Of Birth (Date Field)
- Gender (Checkbox Group)
- Organisation (Autocomplete)

Now that you have created your form you can save it and preview it to view how the user will see it.

Before we go on to more advanced topics use the dynamic form URL in order to load your form in a tab so you can capture some sample data.

In this case `https://[client-url]/dynamic/learn-create-view/`.
