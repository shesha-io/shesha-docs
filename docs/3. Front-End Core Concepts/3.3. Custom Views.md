Sometimes you want to build more complex views based on complex data models or just want to be able to have a bit more liberty when working with views. You can use blank forms to create these views.

You can navigate to the forms settings page which is one of the static sessions of Shesha application where forms are managed. The URL is `https://[client-url]/settings/forms/`.
