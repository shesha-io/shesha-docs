## Autocomplete Component

The autocomplete component enables user to type in text data and it provides suggestions based on the search data.


_The list below displays all the properties an Autocomplete component has._

## Display properties

The display properties of the autocomplete are used to manipulate the UI of the component.

1. **Name** - This property captures the attribute that is in the Entity/Model, it is an autocomplete as user is able to type and a list of options will appear based on the model type of the form. When you clicker on the thunderlike Icon it will complete the label by the name of the attribute.

2. **Label** - The label is used to label/ give a name to the component, as you type the label it should change on the UI.
3. **Label Align** - Is used to align your label to the right or left.
4. **Mode** - The mode is used to capture the mode in which the selection will be made, currently we have two modes Tags and Multiple, which is not quite correct as they function the same, we should have single and multiple options. So that the single allows only one selection and the Multiple allows multiple selections.
5. **Placeholder** - Is used to put in some type to guide the user when capturing or selecting e. "Type to Search"
