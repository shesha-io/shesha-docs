# 5. Status control
 
# When To Use

When you want to have a coloured label status on your form representing different states. For example, GREEN for COMPLETED, RED for OVERDUE.

## Finding The Control
Under the Builder Widgets, go to the Custom Tab and there you will see the `Status Tag` Control which you can drag and drop onto the form designer.

## Understanding The Properties
By default you are greeted with the `Status tag not configured properly` message as you have to assign a few values to some properties.

- **The Default Mapping**
    * The predefined JSON specifies that for the value 1, it displays the text "Completed", with a colour "GREEN". The colour values can be hex values (e.g #FE3421), strings (e.g RED) or RGB values. You can define these properties by editing the JSON for as many values as you want. The "default" specifies what is displayed when a match is not found.

- **Value**
    * If you enter 1 on the `Value` property, the status control changes to GREEN and displays the text "COMPLETED" based on the default mapping.

However, you may want to get the values dynamically from say a drop down, so we will add a dropdown for the AreaType reference list and this will take us to the next important property.

- **Override**
    * Specifying text on the Override property changes the text of what is displayed on the Status form control. In the above snippet, the display text is now province. The default behaviour is to always CAPITALISE all the letters. 

You can also specify an Override expression to change the displayed text dynamically e.g

The above snippet will output "FIRST OPTION" when the first option is selected and "SECOND OPTION" when other options are selected. You can make the expression as complex as you want it to be.

- **Color Settings**
    * Here you can either specify a single color e.g Violet

Alternatively, you can specify a color expression e.g in the below snippet.

The expression can be as complex as you want it to be. In the snippet below, when the first option is selected, the control turns pink otherwise it turns green
