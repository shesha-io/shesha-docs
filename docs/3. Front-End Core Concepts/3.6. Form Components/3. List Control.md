# 3. List Control

# Description
A component for displaying a list of items. This can be used as an alternative to a Child Table component.

## Where to find it?
The component is found under custom section of the component

## Properties
The properties are divided in to 10 sections. Below are the sections and their use

### Display
Here you will find the basic settings of the component.

#### Name
The `name` property of the component.

This property is required and all the component forms will be prefixed with this name. For example, if your component name is `patients` and you want to render a form that has the `firstName` and `lastName`, your form item names will be `patients_0_firstName`, `patients_0_firstName` until `patients_[n]_firstName`, `patients_[n]_firstName`. Where `n` is number of items the form has.

If, by any chance you forget to enter the name property, the component will not render a list of items, event though there is data available.

### Label
The label of the component. By default, this will be hidden as this component usually will be rendering a form that has items with labels, which can make the form look a bit weird.

An example of a List component with the label is shown below:

Below is a default List component after being added:

### Title
This is the title of the list component.

In this text field you can use Mustache syntax like `List of contacts for {{data.name}}`. Also, remember that you have access to the `globalState` in here

### Unique State ID

## Buttons

### Customise Button Group

## Data
Defines options regarding where and how the form gets its data

### Data source
Where the data of the list is coming from. The data can from one of the following two sources:

1. `api` - The `List` is responsible for fetching it's own data
By default, the data will be fetched using the default API url `/api/services/app/Entities/GetAll`. Please check it out to see what options it requires
2. `form` - The form will provide the list with data. The form has to provide the list component with the value. 

Please make sure the data is in an array format where each object corresponds with the form fields

### Entity type
The type of Entity whose data will be displayed in the form.
This property is only required if `Data source` is `form`

### Properties
The properties of the `Entity type` to be fetched. Please note that the `id` property will always be return. It's important, especially for when you want to delete the items from the server

## Query builder
This option allows you to write the filter that will be applied against the data that will be fetched.

## Render
How the items that will be listed should be rendered are determined by the options you make under this section.

### Render Strategy
The rendering strategy of the component. Two strategies are available

1. `External form` - a predefined form will be used to display list items (recommended)
2. `Drag And Drop` - you should manually drag components that will be rendered on every iteration of the list.

Note that each and every form item will will be prefixed with the `List` name and the its corresponding index. For example, a list component named 'list' that renders a form that has a property called `firstName` and that will be rendered 5 times will have `firstName` properties transformed to `list_0_firstName` until `list_4_firstName`.


### Form Path
If you selected `External form` as the render `Render Strategy`, then this option is required. This will be a the form that you want to render

## Selection

### Selection Mode
Which mode of selection the `List` component should support.

Currently there are 3 options:

1. `none` - the list should not allow section
2. `single` - only allow one item to be selected at a time
Below is an example with `signle` mode:
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85956374/222999692-2f494478-03f8-4e49-884f-cdb8673061ea.png)
3. `multiple` - more that one selections can be made on the component.
Below is an example of `multiple` mode:
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85956374/222999726-ebecef48-562c-4ce0-a32c-16ef41e4226d.png)

The selections are stored in the `globalState`. In order to access the selected item(s), your component must have the `Unique State ID` provided. From there you can access the data this way `globalState.[uniqueStateId]`. The data is in this format

```javascript
{
  selectedItemIndexes: [], // list of selected item indeces
  selectedItems: [], // List of selected items. The array will have 1 element if mode is `single`
  selectedItem: {} // Only specified if the mode is `single`, is it's null
}
```

## Delete/Remove Items

### Allow Delete Items
Whether the list should allow you to delete items or not. If this is checked, when you hover over a list item, you will see the delete item like below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85956374/222999749-87988e06-78be-48c2-bce3-3d4f0ca129c0.png)

When you click the buttons, items will be deleted locally.

### Allow Remote Delete
If this option is specified, when you click the delete icon, shown above, the item will be deleted remotely as well. But in order for this to happen, you must have provided the `delete url`

### Delete URL
This option will only be available if `Allow Remote Delete`, above is checked. without this value provided, you will not be able to delete the item at all. Instead you will be shown a error like below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85956374/222999856-0be0e2f5-aa8a-4f4e-bf9a-07cc30e876d8.png)

Below are the options available:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85956374/222999881-32371f43-4915-4291-91cc-9de5cabe39cd.png)

A good example of a valid delete url is provided below

```javascript
return `/api/services/Cdm/PatientContact/Delete?id=${item.id}`;
```

## Submit
This section is only important if the list will be responsible for saving items to the API as an array. For an example, you might have an endpoint like

```javascript
/api/services/Cdm/PatientContacts
```

which receives the payload like 

```json
{
  "patientId": "string",
  "contacts": [
    {
      "name": "string",
      "surname": "string",
    }
  ]
}
```

This is a very rare occasion, but the component allows you to be able to save all the items to the API at once.

Remember that in order for you to achieve this, you must make sure that the button that is used to trigger the `saveListItems` event has the following options:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85956374/222999918-415d68d5-c1c6-4b55-b630-565a756b992d.png)

and the `Unique State ID` should be the same as the `List's`.

### Submit URL
The submit URL

### Submit verb
The submit verb. By default it's `POST`

### On Submit
The function that gets evaluated before submitting the list. If provided, this function should return the payload to be sent to the server. This will only be considered is `Submit URL` has been provided

Below is an example of how the payload can be:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85956374/222999957-7f3773ac-e2a5-46f1-91f6-bbf3d80f468e.png)

`items` is a list of items on the component, which will have been saved locally at this stage.

To save a list item locally you have to either use the `Customize Button Group` of the `List` components or drag a `Button Group` component from the `Builder Widgets`. Make sure the button you click has the following properties and that the `Unique State ID` is the same as that of the `List` component.

## Layout

### Label Col
The label column span. Default is `5`.

### Wrapper Col
The wrapper column span. Default is `13`.

## Search
### Show Quick Search
Whether Quick search should be shown on the component or not. By default it is not

## Pagination

### Show pagination
Whether pagination should be shown on the component or not. By default it is shown.

### Default page size
