When creating custom forms you will be working with the create form Dialog window which can be accessed from the Forms Settings section of the application.

You can navigate to the forms settings page which is one of the static sessions of Shesha application where forms are managed. The URL is `https://[client-url]/settings/forms/`.

You can access the Create Dialog Form by clicking on the Create New button in the button groups menu.

The properties for the form can further be explained below:

- **Type of view** - This is the type of form that you will be creating. There are 4 options
  - **Table View** - This view is used to display a list of items in a table view. It also provides out the box capabilities for viewing and interacting with this list of data.
  - **Details View** - The details view is used to display the data for a specific item.
  - **Form View** - The form view can be used to create forms for capturing data and can be displayed in edit mode or display mode.
  - **Blank View** - This is a blank canvas from which you can create a form or display data.
- **Name** - This the name of the form used to make it easy for users to identify.
- **Description** - The description is an optional field user to further give information about what the form is about.
- **Path** - This is the URL path for the form. All dynamic forms are rendered under the same `dynamic` path. The path you use here will determine how the form is accessed. e.g. if you call you give your form a path of `my-form-view` it will be accessed from `https://[client-url]/dynamic/my-form-view`.
- **Model Type** - The model type is used to bind the form to a specific data model. By selecting a model you will automatically wire up APIs and validations for handling that particular models data in the form.

This field is a drop down that exposes all available models from the domain so you don't need to memorise these.

There are a few more properties under the hood that we will need to be aware off that we will be working with in other areas of the Form Configurator.

- **Markup** - The Markup is a descriptor of your form. It contains the JSON object of all your components and their properties and configurations. We will explain this further when we look at widgets and their properties.
