Most views within a typical enterprise application can be fully configured through the Shesha Forms configurator without the need for any coding. This allows even non-technical users to create application views purely through dragging and dropping form components onto the form designer canvas.

## Naming Conventions

For consistency, forms names should follow a standard naming convention.

### CRUD Forms
Form Names

- For normal CRUD forms the naming convention should be as follows:

    - {Entity Name} {Form Type} {Additional descriptor}" where:
    
        * {Entity Name} is the name of the entity the form is based on
        * {Form Type} indicates which type of form it is (e.g. 'Create', 'Details', 'Table', 'Picker', 'QuickView')
        * {Additional descriptor} is additional information in cases to help distinguish between similar forms e.g.:
        
            * `Customer QuickView` vs `Customer Quickview Comprehensive` - to distinguish between the default Customer Quickview and a more comprehensive version which may be appropriate from selected views.
            * `Payment Create` vs `Payment Create From Customer` to distinguish between the default Payment create view and the one to be used from the Customer details with a Payments child table.

Form Paths

The form path should mirror the form name using the `-` as the separator. For example: 

- Customer-Table
- Customer-Details
- Customer-Create
- Customer-QuickView
- Customer-Picker
- Customer-Picker-FromAccount (view with additional descriptor)

### Non-CRUD Forms

Forms which do not perform a CRUD operation will follow a looser naming convention. If the purpose of the form is still centers around a specific Entity, the form name should follow something along the lines of: **"{Entity Name} {Operation or Purpose of form}"**
