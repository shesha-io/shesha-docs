# 3.2. Main Menu

The main menu is the main means of navigating your way through the system. It is highly configurable allowing you to edit which menu items are visible to the user as well as which roles and permissions have visibility of these menu items and groups.

We will be using edit mode to modify the main menu. You can read this article on <a href="https://shesha-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/3.%20Front-End%20Core%20Concepts/3.4.%20Configured%20Views/1.%20Toggling%20Edit%20Mode/" target="_blank">how to access edit mode</a>.

Groups and items share a few properties that can be edited. These are listed below:

- **Title** - The text for the menu item displayed to the user.
- **Tooltip** - What to display when the user mouses over the menu item.
- **Icon** - An icon from the icons library to best describe what the menu item is for.
- **Visibility** - Used to modify the visibility of the menu item using scripting.
- **Permissions** - The appropriate permissions that are able to view and interact with the menu item. Explained in detail further in the <a href="https://shesha-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/5.%20Fundamentals/5.7.%20Security/1.%20Overview/" target="_blank">Permission Based Security Model</a> article.

When in the edit menu option you are able to add groups and buttons by either using the "Add Group" or "Add New Item" buttons.

## Groups

Groups are container menu items which do not redirect, navigate or execute any code upon being clicked. They are solely used to arrange common logical items together to make navigation easier.

## Items

Items are interactive menu items that are designed to allow the user to navigate through the system when clicked or perform certain actions depending on the type of the item.

The line and separator item types are just visual elements used to separate items from each other. The button item type is used to navigate and execute scripts or code. It introduces 3 new properties that can be configured depending on the Button Action selected.

## Navigate Button Action

When this Button Action is configured the user is able to specify a **Target Url** where the user will be navigated to when the button is clicked.

This is normally a form that has been configured in the Forms configurator.

## Execute Script Button Action

This option allows you to specify code that should be executed in the **Launch Code Editor**. You are able to access all variables from the editor including the global variables.

## Execute Form Action Button Action: TODO

## Dialogue Button Action: TODO
