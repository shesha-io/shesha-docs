To get started with a new Shesha project utilise the Starter projects as the basic project scaffolding.
The full starter project includes the backend and frontend applications you will need to setup a full Shesha solution.

## Download the Full Starter Project Template
 
The easiest way to get started is by downloading a Starter Shesha project from the <a href="https://getshesha.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">getshesha website</a>, which will allow you to dynamically set your project name and namespace.

You can provide various parameters to customise the namespace of the starter project you want to generate. Use the payload below:

- Company Name - **YourCompanyName**
- Project Name - **YourProjectName**
- Project Type - **Full: Empty Starter Project**

A zip file including the following will be generated that you can then customise to your needs:

- **Adminportal (Frontend)** - A reactjs solution for the front end
- **Backend** - An Asp.Net Core solution for the backend
- **Database** - A seeded SQL database with sample data

Unzip the folder generated to your preferred destination.
