# 4. Specifications

Specification Pattern is used to define **named, reusable, combinable and testable filters** for entities and other business objects. More details available <a href="https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/4.4/Specifications" target="_blank">here</a>.

Shesha provides some automation of specifications usage

## Specification Manager

Specification manager allows to manipulate specifications and apply them automatically to any Repository instantiated by the IOC.

Example of usage:

On the example above we activate specifications manually and the **GetAll()** method automatically appends linq expression to the **IQueryable**. **SpecificationManager** is thread-safe and can be used in async methods. When multiple specifications are applied to the same entity type the **SpecificationManager** combines them with logical **And**.

## Specification base class

Shesha provides base class for specifications - **ShaSpecification<T>**. The key difference between Shesha and ABP implementation in integration with the **SpecificationManager**. **ShaSpecification<T>** allows to query additional data from any repository and use it in the generated expression. **Important note**: all specifications are disabled inside the specification itself. It's required to prevent infinite loops.
  
Example of specification class:

## Global specifications
  
Global specifications allow to filter data irrespective of the execution context. It may be useful for permissions checks. To make specification global you just need to decorate it with the **GlobalSpecificationAttribute**.

**NOTE: we should be very careful with the global specifications as they affect entire application**

## Context specifications
  
The affect of the specifications activated using the **SpecificationManager** is limited by the execution context. **SpecificationManager** allows to activate context specifications by two ways:
  
1. Manually using **Use<>()** and  **Use()** methods (see examples above)
2. Automatically on the action level

## Disable specifications
In some cases it may be useful to disable all specifications. The **SpecificationManager** allows to do it using **DisableSpecifications()** method, see example below.

On the action level you can disable all specifications using **DisableSpecificationsAttribute**:

##Front-end support

The Query Builder component allows to use a specifications defined on the back-end as a filter parameter. Specifications are listed in the property list, see the image. Query Builder supports two operations for specifications:
  
1. `Is satisfied` - specification is integrated into the final query as is, i.e. expression returned from `ToExpression` evaluates to true.
2. `Is satisfied when` - specification included into the final query only when some client-side logic (pre-condition) evaluates to true.
