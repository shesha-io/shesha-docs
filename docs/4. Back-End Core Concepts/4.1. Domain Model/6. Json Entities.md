# 6. Json Entities

If an entity has a property that references a child object, it may be advantageous in some circumstances, to store the child object in the database as a Json string, rather than as a separate entity.

This is illustrated in the example below where the `HomeAddress` property is stored as a Json string:

# When to use this approach?

There are two main scenarios when this approach of saving child objects as Json strings should be considered: 

1. **When child objects are expected to be highly nested (i.e. deep object graph)** - In this instance a document database would be ideal which is not currently supported by Shesha. So in this instance saving and retrieving a deeply nested object structure from the database using the traditional approach can be prohibitive from a performance point of view due to the large number of database calls this would require. Treating the child object as a single Json string would therefore bring very significant performance improvements as no additional database calls would be required to retrieve child objects.
2. **If the child objects are expected to be highly heterogeneous (i.e. of different types)** - Any object can be serialised to Json regardless of its type and complexity, which makes this approach ideal when the same property may reference many different types of objects.

## Limitations

Despite the advantages some significant limitations also exist which should be considered before implementation:

1. **Difficult to report on** - Since the data for the object is saved as a Json string in the database it becomes much more difficult to use the data for reporting purposes as reporting tools would need to extract the relevant data elements from the Json string. 
2. **Difficult to update** - Similarly, it becomes much more difficult to update the data through the back-end if that is a requirement.
3. **Fully dependent on parent** - This approach only works child objects whose lifecycle is entirely tied to their parent object. i.e. if parent gets deleted, the child object will also get deleted with it.
4. **Circular relationships** - Child objects which include a property that references an objects within the object hierarchy are not supported. If the child object structure includes properties that reference other child objects within the object hierarchy, this will create a circular relationship within the object structure which will make it impossible to serialise to Json.


# Implementing JsonEntities

## Method 1 - SaveAsJson Attribute

The simplest method simply involves adding the `SaveAsJsonAttribute` attribute to the property whose value should be saved as Json. The Json string will automatically get saved to a database text column of the same name as the property. Using this method, any serializable class can be used as the property type.

### Example

```csharp

/// <summary>
/// A regular 'Person' entity with a property we'd like to store as Json.
/// </summary>
public class PersonEntity: Entity<Guid>
{
    public virtual string Name { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// The Address object will get serialised to Json and get saved in the database as text.
    /// </summary>
    [SaveAsJson]
    public virtual Address HomeAddress { get; set; }
}

public class Address
{
    public virtual string Street { get; set; }

    public virtual string Town { get; set; }

    public virtual int PostalCode { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Child object may also contain its child objects which will get serialised.
    /// </summary>
    public virtual GeometricCoordinates Coordinates { get; set; }
}

public class GeometricCoordinates
{
    public virtual double Latitude { get; set; }

    public virtual double Longitude { get; set; }
}
```

In this case, the saved data in the database will look like:

Also, you can use this nested object on calling the Create/Update endpoint

**Example json**
```json
{
    "name": "Person name",
    "homeAddress": {
        "street":"24 Fitter Rd",
        "town":"Cresslawn",
        "postalCode":1619,
        "coordinates": {
            "latitude":24.01256,
            "longitude":-23.12533
        }
}
```

### Disadvantages of Method 1
The main disadvantage of this approach is that the class is not available through the Entity configurator on the front-end. For this reason, Method 2 described later is generally preferred.


## Method 2 - Inheriting from JsonEntity Class

Method 2 involves inheriting from `JsonEntity` class. The key advantage is that these class get recognised by the form designer and entity configurator on the front-end and are therefore much more full featured.

#### Example

```csharp
public class JsonAddress : JsonEntity
{
    public virtual string Town { get; set; }
    public virtual string Street { get; set; }
    public virtual int PostalCode { get; set; }
}
```

You can add property of `JsonAddress` type to your Entity class
```csharp
public class Person : FullPowerEntity
{
    public virtual string FirstName { get; set; }
    public virtual string LastName { get; set; }

    public virtual JsonAddress Address{ get; set; }
}
```

A table representing an entity in the database must contain a field with the same name as the field but of type `nvarchar(max)` (`StringBlob`, etc)

When an Entity is saved to a database, a field of type inherited from JsonEntity will be converted to a string in the JSON format and stored in the corresponding field in the database table
```json
{
    "town":"Some town",
    "street":"Some street",
    "postalCode": 1234,
    "_className": "Shesha.Test.JsonAddress"
}
```
`"_className"` field is added to each JsonEntity object, which allows to determine the class of the object on the client side and add the correct handlers, forms or some configuration

**Note**: Fields with a type inherited from JsonEntity do not require the addition of `[SaveAsJson]` attribute

When receiving data from the database, this field will contain the deserialized object

**Note**: To increase performance, lazy deserialization of JsonEntity objects has been implemented. If there is no explicit access to the field, deserialization is not performed, and when the base object is subsequently serialized (for example, to transfer to the client), the JsonEntity object returns the data as it was stored in the database

### Inheritance and nesting
You can use inheritance and nesting of JsonEntity classes
```csharp
public class JsonBase : JsonEntity
{
    public virtual string Description { get; set; }
}

public class JsonAddress : JsonBase
{
    public virtual string Town { get; set; }
    public virtual string Street { get; set; }

    public virtual int PostalCode { get; set; }
}

public class JsonOrganisation : JsonBase
{
    public virtual string Name { get; set; }
    public virtual JsonAddress Address { get; set; }
}
```
In the example above, the `Address` will be stored as a nested object of the `JsonOrganization` object (as a single Json string)

### Using untyped JsonEntity

You can also use a base class to store any type inherited from JsonEntity.
```csharp
public class JsonPassport : JsonEntity
{
    public virtual string Number { get; set; }
    public virtual DateTime Date { get; set; }
}

public class JsonDoc : JsonEntity
{
    public virtual string Number { get; set; }
    public virtual int Category { get; set; }
}

public class Person : FullPowerEntity
{
    public virtual string FirstName { get; set; }
    public virtual string LastName { get; set; }

    public virtual JsonEntity Document { get; set; }
}

...

person.Document = new JsonPassport();
// or
person.Document = new JsonDoc();
```

Given that JsonEntity store the `"_className"` field, there are no further problems for deserialization, as well as determine a class on the client side

### Lists of JsonEntities

It is also possible to save lists of JsonEntity objects.
Such lists allow you to store objects of different types (inherited from JsonEntity) in one list.
```csharp
public class Person : FullPowerEntity
{
    public virtual string FirstName { get; set; }
    public virtual string LastName { get; set; }

    [SaveAsJson]
    public virtual IList<JsonEntity> Document { get; set; }
}

...

person.Documents = new List<JsonEntity>();
person.Documents.Add(new JsonDoc());
person.Documents.Add(new JsonPassport());
```
**Note**: Fields with `IList<JsonEntity>` type require the addition of `[SaveAsJson]` attribute

## References to regular Entities
JsonEntity allows to add fields with type of regular Entity
```csharp
public class JsonAddress : JsonEntity
{
    public virtual string Town { get; set; }
    public virtual string Street { get; set; }
    public virtual int PostalCode { get; set; }

    public virtual Person ContactPerson { get; set; }
}

public class Person : FullPowerEntity
{
    public virtual string FirstName { get; set; }
    public virtual string LastName { get; set; }

    public virtual JsonAddress Address{ get; set; }
}
```
`Address` field will be stored as
```json
{
    "town":"Some town",
    "street":"Some street",
    "postalCode": 1234,
    "person": {
        "_displayName":"Bob Sponge",
        "_className":"Shesha.Domain.Person",
        "id":"635e9f2b-2ca5-4cea-898c-ab5d56b1100a"
    },
    "_className": "Shesha.Test.JsonAddress"
}
```
