# 5.6. Configuration Packages

### Packages

Shesha supports distribution of configuration items using packages. Package is a zip archive with `.shaconfig` extension. It contains configuration items in json format and attached files if any. Structure of the package provided below:

        zip/
        ├── shesha/
        │   ├── forms/
        │   │   ├── form1.json
        │   │   └── form2.json
        │   ├── models/
        │   │   ├── organisation.json
        │   │   └── person.json
        │   ├── reference-lists/
        │   │   └── statuses.json
        │   └── workflows/
        │       ├── disconnection.json
        │       ├── new-connection.json
        │       └── GenericProcess.bpmn     <-- referenced by shesha/workflows/Disconnection.json
        └── his.bookings/
            └── forms/ 

First level folders are identified as modules except system names (e.g. [resources]).
Second level folders represent item type (e.g. form, workflow etc).
All json files in the 2nd level folders are identified as individual items.

### Generic UI
Package can be exported and imported manually using a generic UI.
There are two generic configurable actions for packages distribution:

1. `Configuration Framework: Export Items`. This action opens a generic UI that prepares a `.shaconfig` package.  
2. `Configuration Framework: Import Items`. This action opens a generic UI that allows to import `.shaconfig` package created by the `Configuration Framework: Export Items` action.

Toolbar configuration with support of export/import:

### Configuration Framework: Export Items

This action opens a modal dialog, see an image below.

It supports 3 modes of export: 

1. **Live** - includes only published versions of configuration items. It's a default view for regular users.
2. **Ready** - includes ready versions where available with fallback to live versions.
3. **Latest** - includes latest versions of configuration items irrespectively of their status. 

Currently packages contain only one version of configuration item. Note: it may be changed after implementation of dependencies management.

### Configuration Framework: Import Items

This action opens a modal dialog that allows to import `.shaconfig` files. It supports preview and conditional import.

After package uploading it shows content of the package and allows to choose items to import.
