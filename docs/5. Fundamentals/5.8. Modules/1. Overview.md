# 1. Overview

Shesha encourages a modular approach to building applications. This means that wherever possible, applications should be assembled from pre-existing functionality packaged as 'Shesha modules', then customized to address any gaps, rather than built from scratch.

Shesha modules therefore form the basic building blocks containing the pre-built functionality from which Shesha Applications are built.

The diagram below illustrates the main components that make up a Shesha Module.

From the diagram above one can see that a Shesha module is made up of two main components: 

1. A Front-end package, and
2. A back-end package

Together these packages form the Shesha Module. Note however that if the Shesha Module is only intended to provide functionality relating to the front-end only, it is not necessary for it to have a matching back-end package and vice-versa. Similarly, though the diagram above illustrates that Shesha Modules may contain a lot of different types of artifacts, some Shesha Modules may in fact be very small and only contain one or two components.

# The Back-end Package

>**Shesha Modules should not be confused with <a href="https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Module-Development-Basics" target="_blank">Abp Modules</a>. Shesha Modules are a higher level of encapsulation that cater for additional Shesha-specific concepts. On the back-end Shesha Modules actually build on top of the Abp’s modularisation approach and a Shesha Module will therefore be composed of one or more Abp modules. It is therefore useful for Shesha application developers to familiarise themselves with <a href="https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Module-Development-Basics" target="_blank">Abp Module development basics</a>**

The diagram above further illustrates the types of artifacts that may be contained within a back-end package.

# TODO: 

* If several Abp Modules make up the Shesha module, it is assumed that the SheshaModule assembly attributes will be added to only one Abp module at the top of the module dependency hierarchy defined through the ‘DependsOn’ attributes.
